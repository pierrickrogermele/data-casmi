This molecule is a fungal metabolite. The contest data were acquired on a Dionex solvent delivery system integrated with Thermo Fisher Scientific linear ion trap/FT-ICR (LTQ-FT Ultra) mass spectrometer operated in negative ion electrospray mode. The data were acquired using flow injection. The mobile phase consisted on 50:50 (v/v) water: acetonitrile both containing 0.1% formic acid. MS/MS data were acquired by applying CID in the linear ion trap (q=0.25 and activation time of 30 msec) and m/z measurements in the FT-ICR. For MS/MS, precursor selection width of +/-2.0Da was used. Data are provided for both the precursor of m/z 515 and 561. Normalised collision energy of 35% was used for CID. The FT-ICR was operated at the resolving power of 100,000. The expected mass accuracy for this instrument is <3ppm. The isotopic peak for the ion of m/z 515 is not visible due to low abundance.
