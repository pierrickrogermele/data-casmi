This molecule was detected in human serum and tissues. The contest data were acquired on a Shimadzu Prominence UFLC XR solvent delivery system integrated with a Shimadzu LC-MS-IT-TOF ion trap/time-of flight (IT-TOF) mass spectrometer operating in negative ion electrospray mode.  Reversed phase separation was carried out using a Waters XBridge 2.0 x 50mm C18 column (2.5 Âµm particle size) and a mobile phase consisting of  water + 0.1% formic acid as solvent A and acetonitrile as solvent B. A linear gradient from 20-95%B operating at a flow rate of 0.22mL/min over 10 minutes was applied. Under these conditions the compound eluted at the retention time of 6.1 min. The expected mass accuracy of the instrument is <7ppm. MS/MS data were collected under the following conditions: collision energy 50%, collision gas 50%; isolation width 1Da; activation q=0.25; ion accumulation ASC; precursor ion m/z 351; m/z range > 100.
