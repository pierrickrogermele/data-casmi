This molecule was detected in human plasma with a retention time of 493 seconds. The data were acquired applying UPLC-MS on a Waters Acquity UPLC integrated with a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer operating in electrospray positive ion mode. A Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 µm) column was applied. A reversed phase linear gradient elution operating at a flow rate of 0.35mL/min over 15 minutes from 5%A to 95%A was applied with water (+0.1% formic acid) as solvent A and methanol (+0.1% formic acid) as solvent B. The expected mass accuracy of the instrument is <3ppm. MS/MS data were acquired in positive ion mode applying HCD and m/z measurements in the Orbitrap Velos with a precursor selection width of +/-1.5Da, a precursor m/z of 385 and normalised collision energy of 30%. The expected mass accuracy for MS/MS data is <5ppm.
