This molecule was detected in human urine with a retention time of 5.40 minutes. The data were acquired applying UPLC-MS on a Thermo Scientific Accela integrated with a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer operating in electrospray positive ion mode. A Thermo Scientific Accucore Amide HILIC (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 2.6µm) column was applied. A HILIC linear gradient elution operating at a flow rate of 0.20mL/min over 12 minutes was applied from 5%A to 50%A with acetonitrile (with 5mM ammonium acetate) as solvent A and water (with 5mM ammonium acetate) as solvent B. The expected mass accuracy of the instrument is <5ppm. MS/MS data were acquired in positive ion mode applying CID in the linear ion trap and m/z measurements in the Orbitrap Velos with a precursor selection width of +/-1.5Da, m/z range > 100, a precursor m/z of 308 and normalised collision energy of 35%. The expected mass accuracy for MS/MS data is <5ppm.
