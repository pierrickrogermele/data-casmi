This molecule was detected in human urine with a retention time of 3.38 minutes. The data were acquired applying UPLC-MS on a Thermo Scientific Ultimate3000 integrated with a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer operating in electrospray negative ion mode. A Thermo Scientific Accucore Amide HILIC (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 2.6µm) column was applied. A HILIC linear gradient elution operating at a flow rate of 0.20mL/min over 12 minutes was applied from 5%A to 50%A with acetonitrile (with 5mM ammonium acetate) as solvent A and water (with 5mM ammonium acetate) as solvent B. The expected mass accuracy of the instrument is <3ppm. MS/MS data were acquired in negative ion mode applying HCD and m/z measurements in the Q Exactive with a precursor selection width of +/-1.5Da, a precursor m/z of 194 and normalised collision energy of 80%. The expected mass accuracy for MS/MS data is <5ppm.
