This molecule was detected in human serum with a retention time of 184 seconds. The data were acquired applying UPLC-MS on a Thermo Scientific Ultimate3000 integrated with a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer operating in electrospray negative ion mode. A Thermo Scientific GOLD C18 (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.9µm) column was applied. A reversed phase linear gradient elution operating at a flow rate of 0.35mL/min over 12 minutes from 5%A to 95%A was applied with water (+0.1% formic acid) as solvent A and methanol (+0.1% formic acid) as solvent B. The expected mass accuracy of the instrument is <3ppm. MS/MS data were acquired in negative ion mode applying HCD and m/z measurements in the Q Exactive with a precursor selection width of +/-1.5Da, m/z range > 100, a precursor m/z of 219 and normalised collision energy of 80%. The expected mass accuracy for MS/MS data is <5ppm.
