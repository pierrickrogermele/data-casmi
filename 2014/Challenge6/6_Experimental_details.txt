This molecule was detected in human urine with a retention time of 209 seconds. The data were acquired applying UPLC-MS on a Thermo Scientific Ultimate3000 integrated with a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer operating in electrospray negative ion mode. A Thermo Scientific GOLD C18 (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.9µm) column was applied. A reversed phase linear gradient elution operating at a flow rate of 0.35mL/min over 10 minutes from 5%A to 95%A was applied with water (+0.1% formic acid) as solvent A and methanol (+0.1% formic acid) as solvent B. The expected mass accuracy of the instrument is <5ppm. MS/MS data were acquired in negative ion mode applying HCD and m/z measurements in the Orbitrap Velos with a precursor selection width of +/-1.5Da, m/z range > 100, a precursor m/z of 167 and normalised collision energy of 70%. The expected mass accuracy for MS/MS data is <5ppm.
