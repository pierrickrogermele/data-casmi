This molecule is an unreported natural product identified in a terrestrial plant. The contest data were acquired on a Waters 2695 solvent delivery system integrated with a Waters SYNAPT quadrupole/time-of flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer operating in positive ion electrospray mode.  Reversed phase separation was carried out using a Hypersil GOLD 2.0 x 150mm C18 column (5 Âµm particle size) and a mobile phase consisting of  water + 0.1% formic acid as solvent A and acetonitrile as solvent B. A linear gradient from 6-36%B operating at a flow rate of 0.20mL/min over 30 minutes was applied. Under these conditions the compound eluted at the retention time of 10.8 min. The expected mass accuracy of the instrument is <5ppm in MS mode or < 10ppm (or < 1.8mDa) in MS/MS mode. MS/MS data were acquired using CID with argon as a collision gas, with a precursor selection width of +/ 1.5 Da, a precursor m/z of 323 and a collision energy of 15eV.
